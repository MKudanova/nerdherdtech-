    <h1>PHYSICAL AND HARDWARE ACCESS POLICY</h1>
    <h2>for WWW.NERDHEARDTECH.COM</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the official access policy for NerdHerd Technologies Inc. This page outlines our rules for physical entry, hardware access, and use of removable media in a way that keeps our workplace secure, efficient, and—let’s be honest—nerdy.
    </p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of this policy is to protect NerdHerd Technologies’ physical assets, sensitive data, and infrastructure from unauthorized access, theft, or harm. Physical security is just as important as digital security, and together, they form a strong defense against modern threats.
