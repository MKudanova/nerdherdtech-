        <h1>PHYSICAL AND HARDWARE ACCESS POLICY</h1>
        <h2>for NERDHEARD TECHNOLOGY</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the official access policy for NerdHerd Technologies employees. This page outlines our rules for physical entry, hardware access, and use of removable media in a way that keeps our workplace secure, efficient, and—let’s be honest—nerdy.
        </p>

        <p>
            
        </p>

        <h3>Office Suite Access Policy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Hours:</strong> Monday–Friday, 9:00am–5:00pm. Receptionist on duty during these hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Entry:</strong> Employees must use their assigned access badges. Visitors check in at reception and receive a visitor badge.</li>
            <li><strong>After-Hours Access:</strong> Only approved staff with proper authorization. All after-hours entries are logged and monitored by cameras.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Tech:</strong> Electronic card readers, security cameras, and alarm systems protect all entry points.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Reminders:</strong> No “tailgating.” Always display badges. Report lost badges immediately.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Center Access Policy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authorized Personnel Only:</strong> Access limited to IT staff and designated managers with badge and biometric authentication.</li>
            <li><strong>24/7 Access:</strong> Data center is accessible only to authorized personnel at all times; all entries/exits are logged.</li>
            <li><strong>Vendor Access:</strong> Vendors and non-employees require pre-approval and must be escorted by IT at all times.</li>
            <li><strong>Cabinet Security:</strong> Server racks are kept locked at all times. Keys held only by IT staff.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Access:</strong> Emergency entry is permitted for authorized staff only and must be logged with the on-call manager.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Removable Media Policy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Approved Devices Only:</strong> Only company-issued, encrypted USB drives may be used. Personal USBs are strictly prohibited.</li>
            <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> USB ports are disabled by default; exceptions require IT approval. Regular audits are performed.</li>
            <li><strong>If in Doubt:</strong> Never plug in an unknown USB device. Report it to IT immediately. Violations may lead to disciplinary action (and disappointed IT staff).</li>
        </ul>
